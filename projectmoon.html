        <p>Lobotomy Corperation is a management sim title which released on April 9th, 2018. With the assistance of your ai companion Angela, you as Manager X must manage a facility which houses Abnormalities, otherworldy creatures which have the potential to kill your employees. Each creature has four different work types, and different preferences for which worker attempts to study them. Our goal for 50 days in this facility is to collect enough energy from these abnormalities each day. This game is exceptionally challenging, known for being a management simulator from hell. It is also of course, one of my greatest accomplishments in playing and beating in full. The events in the end spark the beginning in Librairy of Ruina, and we continue to explore the remnants of Lobotomy Corperation in Limbus Company's cantos.</p>
