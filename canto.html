   <p>Cantos are the main story chatpers of the game. They further push the narrative while also providing unique focus to one of it's sinners. We often see the sinner's backstory, their greatest villains or enemies, understand their traumas and push them towards confronting their past. While we many not always succeed, each step allows each sinner to continue to grow. </p>
