  Limbus Company is a a single player turn-based gacha game released in Febuary 26, 2023. It is a game following a cast of 13 Sinners, exploring a dystopian City in a bus attempting to aquire powerful objects known as Golden Boughs scattered throughout. The team is no more than a group of strangers at first, each with their own flaws. We experience the groups infighting, deaths, and challenges across the City through different Canto chapters. We view it through the perspective of Dante, sinner #10 and executive manager of all other sinners.   <br>
